                My final project will be a webpage promoting my pitching lessons and clinics that I run in my hometown. I will include pages that talk about different pitches to throw, arm health, and the mentality a pitcher must have when he or she takes the mound. i will also include an "About me" page so everyone who signs up would have a good idea about who I am. I am also thinking about adding a calender so people will see my availablity times.
